This week, I revisited key Python concepts

1. Opening and Closing Files in Python:
We refreshed the process of handling file operations using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions. I reviewed how to properly open files using the open() function, specifying modes such as:

'r' for reading,
'w' for writing (which overwrites existing content),
'a' for appending to an existing file, and
'rb' or 'wb' for handling binary files.
